1. Customer Placing the Largest Number Orders --> From codingninjas.com

Hint : Use the sub-query as a table, then pick the columns you need as output
select customer_number 
from 
    (select customer_number, count(order_number)Tot_orders
     from orders
     group by customer_number
     order by Tot_orders desc
     limit 1)d

2. To get he second highest salary --> From codingninjas.com

Hint: First remove the max salary from the dataset using filter condition, then get the max salary from the remaining dataset
select max(salary) 
from l1
where salary not in (
		    select max(salary) 	
                    from l1
                    )
		    
3. To check if a customer named 'Shashank' has placed any orders or not; just a lookup

Hint - You dont have to use join when all you need is a lookup operation. 
	Hence use 'EXISTS' which works like a boolean that is if your subquery returns true, 
	only then the main query will return the records

select *
from customers c
where exists (
	      select order_id from orders o
              where o.customer_id = c.customer_id
              and c.customer_name = 'Shashank'
              );

'WHERE' in the sub query acts like a 'ON' operation in join
